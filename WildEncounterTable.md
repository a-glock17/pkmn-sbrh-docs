## SBRH Encounter Table
-----
The following tables are the encounters for every route and city where encounters are valid. There will be minimum 4 encounters per method per route (4 in the grass, 4 from fishing/surfing). Every legendary and mythical pokemon can be caught as well. All route method rates should equal 100%. If they do not, please fix them and open a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/working-with-your-remote-repository-on-github-or-github-enterprise/creating-an-issue-or-pull-request) for me to review and accept. PRs made purely to vandalize will be declined. There are only two fishing rods available in game: the Good Rod and the Super Rod.
