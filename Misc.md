## Misc Info

Level curve is as follows:
* Gym #1 -> lvl. 14
* Gym #2 -> lvl. 22
* Gym #3 -> lvl. 29
* Gym #4 -> lvl. 35
* Gym #5 -> lvl. 41
* Gym #6 -> lvl. 50
* Gym #7 -> lvl. 60
* Gym #8 -> lvl. 64
* E4 #1 -> lvl. 67
* E4 #2 -> lvl. 68
* E4 #3 -> lvl. 71
* E4 #4 -> lvl. 74
* Champion -> lvl. 77

This is a *typical* curve in the sense that it doesn't ramp up incredibly quickly like other ROM hacks. This was my goal as I wanted a Nintendo-feeling curve whiile keeping the games difficult for non-pro players. A possible *Expert Mode* may be included which will boost these levels up dramatically. Updates coming in the far future. (Hopefully)
