# pkmn-sbrh-docs
This repo is purely documentation for SBRH. No ROM files are to be uploaded until release. Please take note that the documentation may be difficult to read at times. For best looking documentation, please read this on a wide screen such as a desktop, laptop, or modern tablet.

I am **NOT** the owner of Pokémon Sapphire, The Pokémon Company, Creatures Inc., and do not have any stake in any of these companies including Nintendo. This ROM is not to be sold or otherwise distributed for profits. This is a free project that contains no code owned by any of the companies listed above. I **WILL NOT** provide the vanilla ROM of Pokémon Sapphire or the modified version(s) under any circumstances.

I **WILL NOT** provide links to software that allows patching of ROMs. If there are any concerns you have, direct them to my [Twitter Account](https://twitter.com/saph_spl). All documented changes, such as: stat changes, moveset changes, trainer team changes, map changes, etc. will be recorded into one of the following files: "PokemonStatChanges.md", "WildEncounterTable.md", "GymLeaders.md", "RegionTrainers.md", "MiscDataChanges.md".

Documentation will be finished *BEFORE* the actual modifications are made to a legally sourced ROM. The Pokédex will only include Pokémon #0001 to #0386 as these are the only Pokémon available in Pokémon Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald.

To have a visual of the new map, go to *./MapData/*. To have a visual of every Pokémons new stats and abilities, go to *./PKMN_Data/*. In game examples of these stats and abilities have been shown in a modified version of Pokemon Black. These screencaps can be found in *./PKMN_Data/b2w2_Screencaps/*.
